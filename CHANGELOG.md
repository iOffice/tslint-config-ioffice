## [Unreleased]


## [0.1.0] - April 26, 2018
- First release of the guide.
- There is only very basic rules.

### Rules
- `io-export-style`: This rule is very specific to iOffice and does not have any options. This rule
  is meant to disallow the use of multiple `export` keywords and to disallow the user of default
  exports.
